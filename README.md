Phishing Indicators Identified

1. Suspicious Sender Domain
The email claims to be from a “Security Team,” but the sender domain (secure-account-verify.com) does not belong to any legitimate organization.

3. Urgency and Fear-Based Language
The message pressures the user by threatening account suspension within 24 hours, a common tactic used in phishing emails.

5. Generic Greeting
The email uses “Dear User” instead of addressing the recipient by name, indicating a mass-sent message.

7. Suspicious Link
The verification link uses a non-trusted domain and HTTP instead of HTTPS, suggesting it may redirect users to a malicious website.

9. Failed Email Authentication (Header Analysis)
The simulated header analysis shows SPF, DKIM, and DMARC failures, indicating the email was not sent from an authorized mail server.
